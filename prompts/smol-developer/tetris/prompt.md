# Webpage and Game Specifications

### 1. **HTML Structure:**

- Use HTML5 doctype and UTF-8 character encoding.
- Title the webpage as "AI Generated Tetris Game".
- Include a `<h1>` heading with the text "AI Generated Tetris Game".
- Add an HTML5 `<canvas>` element with the id="gameCanvas" to host the game. Ensure the canvas size is suitable for a vertical layout and is responsive, scaling correctly on various screen sizes.
- Under the canvas, include a button with id="restartButton" labeled "Restart Game". This button should restart the game upon being clicked.
- Create a display area with id="scoreBoard" under the button to show the current score.

### 2. **CSS Styles:**

- Employ a vibrant and modern color scheme for the webpage, game canvas, and elements such as headings, buttons, and the score display.
- The game canvas should feature contrasting colors for each type of Tetrimino.
- Center the game canvas vertically and horizontally on the page, using CSS Flexbox or Grid.
- Implement smooth transitions and effects to improve user experience.
- Follow modern design principles for typography, button designs, and other UI elements.

### 3. **JavaScript Game Logic:**

- Follow the standard rules of Tetris for the game.
- Allow the player to control the Tetrimino pieces using the arrow keys: move left/right, rotate, and drop faster.
- The game should clear a filled horizontal line and increase the player's score.
- The game should end if the stacked Tetrimino pieces reach the top of the game area.
- Clicking the "Restart Game" button should reset the game state and the score.
- Implement a realistic difficulty progression by gradually increasing the speed of the falling Tetrimino pieces as the score increases.
- This section is of utmost importance and the AI should prioritize the full and complete implementation of the game's logic. 

### 4. **Code Requirements:**

- Write the game in pure, vanilla JavaScript with no external dependencies.
- The code should be well-structured, efficient, and well-commented.
- Divide the game logic into logical sections: initialization, game logic update, event handling, and rendering. Fully implement and complete each declared function.
- Enclose the game logic within a self-invoking function to avoid polluting the global scope.
- Implement robust error handling to prevent the game from crashing during gameplay.

### Additional Instructions:

- The webpage and game should be compatible across all modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
- The game UI and design should be simple, vibrant, and adhere to modern design principles.
- The final code should be ready to run without any additional steps or dependencies. It should be written such that it can be copied directly into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files and run without any errors.
