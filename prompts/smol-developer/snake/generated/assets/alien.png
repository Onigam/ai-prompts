I cannot generate an image file like "assets/alien.png" as I am a text-based AI. However, I can provide you with a suggestion on how to create the alien image.

You can use any image editing software like Adobe Photoshop, GIMP, or even MS Paint to create a pixel art representation of the alien. The image should be small, around 16x16 or 32x32 pixels, and saved in the PNG format. Once you have created the image, save it as "alien.png" in the "assets" folder of your project.

Remember to use a pixel-like design to mimic the style of the original Space Invaders game.
